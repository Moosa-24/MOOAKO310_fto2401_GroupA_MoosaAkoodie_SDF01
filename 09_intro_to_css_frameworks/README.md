having trouble loading the right colors when i open the website,
changed dark theme color to greenish color as well, then eveyrthing worked fine


used what the project guide - step 4 told me to use, its not working, 
 i wouldve just used the "-webkit-transition" i learned in scrimba which 
makes the website usable on multiple devices but this project isnt about that, 
i am running late with this project and wont have time to check up with you @Joshua 
on how to fix it because i have to go somewhere right now...
its 16:13,Friday while typing this


the mb-2 was siupposed to add some space between the links, i cant seem to get it to work properly

for image class above this note.. only mb-10 & 20 were working nicely..not mb-15, 
so i just left it at mb-20 even though it looks like there's more of a gap than in the 
png i was given as a reference....ALSO step 5(Footer Bottom Flex Container) - the aligning thing didnt work, so i just said ml-64

having issues from git commit and git push origin main(didnt want to work for me so i had to manually add changes here again
